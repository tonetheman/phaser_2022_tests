## tweentest2
Looks about the same as tweentest1 but there are layers and all of the glyphs are all created at once.

## tweentest1
Just getting going again. A small test that has a stack of cards reprsented as a Sprite. There is no redraw the top card is the only image really being drawn.
Need to try again with all of the cards drawn to see if it makes a difference in performance.
